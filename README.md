Overview

This project was created as part of the COM518 university module and focuses on developing a basic Node.js web application using modern JavaScript (ES Modules). The main goal was to gain practical experience with setting up a local server, managing packages, and handling simple routing within a Node environment.

The application runs on a lightweight server using app.mjs and listens on port 3000 by default. It serves as a foundation for understanding backend development with JavaScript and demonstrates how to structure a small server-side application using modular code, external dependencies, and common Node.js conventions.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js

Installation

git clone https://github.com/Blaiset21/COM518_Assessment_code.git
cd COM518_Assessment_code

npm install

Running the App

Use the following command to start the server:

node app.mjs

By default, the application runs on:

http://localhost:3000

You can change the port by modifying the configuration in app.mjs.
